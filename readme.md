# Braille Trainer 3 (Braille On Rail)
Here are the parts for Braille Trainer v3  - a continuation of the [Braille Trainer project](https://github.com/zuevval/braille).<br>
Created with SolidWorks 2017.<br>
Code for Braille Trainer v3: 
[github.com/zuevval/braille3](https://github.com/zuevval/braille3).<br>
The primary new feature: a  **multi-character refreshable Braille display** ([previous designes](https://github.com/zuevval/braille) comprised a single Braille cell). <br>
This mechanical display was conceived as a low-cost alternative for existing piezoelectric Braille displays. 
The model is currently under development, but if you are interested in this design and would like to access parts in a format other than SolidWorks documents, feel free to email me at valera.zuev.zva@gmail.com <br>
